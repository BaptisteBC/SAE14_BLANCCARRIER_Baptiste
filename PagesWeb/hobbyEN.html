                    I have been practicing classical archery in a club for 4 years now. I started competitions last year and I don't intend to stop there. Archery is an essential sport in my life as it helps me to concentrate and channel my energy. While I'm shooting, I don't think about anything but my arrow and I use that feeling in my everyday life to be more efficient. Archery also enforces my team spirit as I have never practiced alone. This sport teaches me humility, respect and mutual aid which are essential qualities in everyday life and in the professional world.

                    I have for amibition to continue and to persevere in this sport which fascinates me, I will give the best of myself and participate in a maximum of competitions with the aim of improving me as well on the physical level as mental. I like to evolve with my way of shooting, as well at short distance (60ft) as at long distance (230ft). If there is one sport I would like to never get tired of, it is archery. But that is not likely to happen because once I would feel I am not progressing anymore, a multitude of ways to shoot will present themselves to me and I will start my progression from the beginning as a new adventure.
